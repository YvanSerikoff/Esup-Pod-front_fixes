# Contribution Guide - Esup-Pod V5 (Frontend)

Bienvenue dans le dépôt du frontend Esup-Pod V5. Ce document a pour but de vous guider à la fois sur l'architecture du projet et sur nos règles de contribution pour maintenir un standard de qualité élevé.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps** (links, snippets).
* **Describe the behavior you observed** after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps.
* Include details about your environment:
  * **Which version of Pod are you using?**
  * **What’s the name and version of the browser you’re using**?

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain quality
* Fix problems that are important to users
* Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Make sure that your pull request targets the `dev` branch.
2. Your PR status is in `draft` while it’s still a work in progress.
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks (CI) are passing.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to…" not "Moves cursor to…")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
  * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
  * :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  * :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

### Naming Conventions and Case Styles

Use consistent casing across the codebase so files and symbols are easy to read and to distinguish by language:

* **JavaScript / TypeScript**: Use `camelCase` for variables, functions, hooks, and object properties (`usePlaylist`, `fetchVideos`, `selectedVideoId`).
* **React components**: Use `PascalCase` for component names and file names (`VideoCard.tsx`, `SidebarMenu.tsx`).
* **Constants / enums / configuration values**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for shared constants when they are truly constant (`API_BASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`).
* **CSS / CSS Modules**: Use `kebab-case` for class names and custom property names (`video-card`, `page-header`, `--brand-primary`).
* **Files**: Prefer descriptive names that match their purpose; use kebab-case for CSS files when relevant and PascalCase for React component files.
* **Avoid mixing styles**: Do not use `camelCase` for CSS classes or `kebab-case` for JavaScript identifiers.

### Typography

Please use these typographic characters in all displayed strings:

* Use Apostrophe (’) instead of single quote (')
  * English samples: don’t, it’s
  * French samples: J’aime, l’histoire
* Use the ellipsis (…) instead of 3 dots (...)
  * English sample: Loading…
  * French sample: Chargement…
* Use typographic quotes (“ ”) instead of neutral quotes (" ")
  * English sample: You can use the “Description” field below.
  * French sample: Utilisez le champ « Description » ci-dessous

### Languages

The application uses locale files under `src/locales/` as the single source of truth for user-facing text. Every visible string should be defined in the relevant dictionary, then consumed through the translation helper instead of being written directly in components.

* **Source of truth**: Use the files `src/locales/fr.ts`, `src/locales/en.ts`, and `src/locales/es.ts`.
* **Key structure**: Keep translations grouped by domain (`common`, `auth`, `home`, `preferences`, `filters`, etc.) to match the project conventions.
* **No hardcoded strings**: Do not write literal text directly in JSX, CSS labels, or UI metadata when a translation key exists.
* **Examples from the project**: prefer values such as `common.loading`, `auth.loginTitle`, `preferences.languageSectionTitle`, and `home.welcomeSubtitle` instead of raw strings like "Chargement…" or "Login".
* **Add keys in all locales**: When a new user-facing label is introduced, add it consistently to every locale file to avoid missing translations.
* **Use existing keys first**: Before creating a new key, check whether an equivalent translation already exists in the dictionary files.
* **Formatting and typography**: Keep the locale values responsible for punctuation and special characters, such as ellipses and apostrophes, as already used in the existing language files (`Chargement…`, `Bienvenue…`, `Niveau d’études`).

## Architecture & Conventions (Frontend specific)

This project is based on **Next.js** and **React**.

### Dos & Don'ts

* **TypeScript :** This project is strictly typed. Verify them before commiting with `yarn typecheck`
* **Liting :** Do not commit code with ESLint errors. Use `yarn lint` to check before commiting. (The project is configured with a pre-commit hook).
* **Side effects (useEffect) :** Avoid synchronous `setState` in `useEffect`, this triggers cascading renders.
* **API requests :** All backend communication must go through `authFetch` and be encapsulated in a hook using **React Query**.
* **Desig System :** This project uses **Cunningham**. For any new integration, please prioritize Cunningham over MUI. If you modify `cunningham.ts`, you need to recompile the tokens with the `yarn build-theme` command.

### Tests

We are gradually implementing unit tests using **Vitest**.

* Run the tests: `yarn test`
* Test files use the `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension and are located in the same folder as the component being tested.

Thank you for your contribution !
